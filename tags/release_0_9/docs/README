The steps:

1) May be necessary if "makeskel" and "fpdoc" are obsolete ( many complains on syntax well compiled by FPC )

  You should update "{$FPC}/fcl/passrc/*" with files from "./fpc_fix" and "make clean all" in {$FPC}/fcl/passrc and then 
  in {$FPC}/utils/fpdoc, and finally to replace "makeskel & unitdiff & fpdoc" with the built ones.

2) Not necessary. Do it if You wonna MGEGUI->FPC data type referencing.

./utils_fpc/make_xml.sh 
  -> it'll create XML doc skeletons for FPC source files (RTL & FCL by default) 
     in "/usr/share/doc/fp-libs-all/xml"

3) Also not necessary. If You have FP-DOCS updates from FreePascal SVN then may to replace the skeletons
   generated in step 2) with updated files ( with descriptions, examples, ... )

./utils_fpc/update_for_svn.sh  -> it'll replace some part of the skeletons with XML files from the SVN-ed docs sorces 
  ( "/usr/src/fpdocs/" by default )

4) Not necessary. Take this step only if step 2) was made:

./utils_fpc/make_html.sh 
  -> it'll create Freepascal lib HTML doc files in "/usr/share/doc/fp-libs-all/html" based on XML from step 2) updated in step 3)
   and reflecting the current FPC sources.

5) ./util_msegui/make_xml.sh 
  -> it'll create XML doc skeletons for MSE GUI library source files in "/usr/share/doc/msegui/xml"

6) ./util_msegui/make_html.sh 
  -> it'll create MSE GUI lib HTML doc files in "/usr/share/doc/msegui/html" based on XML from step 5) and reflecting 
     the current MSE GUI library sources.

Notes:

1) files in ./xml_templates are prototypes of 1-st pages of dos parts. The files should be renamed !
2) to build docs for FPC base & extra packages - just uncomment "do_base_pkg" or/and "do_extra_pkg" 
   in ./utils_fpc/make_xml.sh and the related "do_it.." in ./utils_fpc/make_html.sh;
3) hardly probable but some utils may be needed depending on user's OS - textutils, hevea, xml2html,... 
4) see *.ini files in ./ini subdirectory - edit them with a care !
5) user's doc changes should be made to XML files and then these files overwrite autogenerated skeletons. 
   Never edit XML files in the target doc directory as all your edits may be erased when autogenerating ! 
6) tested under Linux (Debian 3.1) only!

The below bad files aren't necessary to fix but for them to the get doc info from.

============================

		Bad FPC files:

fcl/image:
  fpimage.pp, line 319 - letter case dependency may appear
    replace {$I FPColors.inc} -> {$I fpcolors.inc}

packages/base/paszlib:
  zbase.pas, line 395 -> comment "MAX_MATCH = ??", it's safe due to right defines
  
packages/base/pasjpeg:
  jmemsys.pas -> it's a template file, just ignore this error
  
  jmorecfg.pas, line 221 -> comment "RGB_PIXELSIZE = ??", it's safe due to right defines
  
packages/base/sqlite:
  sqlite.pp, lines 150 & 151 -> put ";" between "PChar" and "External"
  
packages/extra/gtk2/libglade:
  glade-xml.inc -> replace all occureneces of "self:PGladeXML" with "_self:PGladeXML" ( keyword as identifier misuse )

packages/extra/x11:
  xi.pp, line 243 -> keyword as inedtifier again, just replace "Absolute" -> "_Absolute". 
                     Note of other software problems may arise where this constant is referenced by name !

packages/extra/numlib:
  det.pas, dsl.pas,...inv.pas -> letter case dependencies may appear
    replace {$I DIRECT.INC} -> {$I direct.inc}

============================

		Bad MSEGUI files:

kernel:
  mseformatstr.pas, line 122  ->  replace {$ifend} for {$endif}
 
* corrected in ver.367 ?
