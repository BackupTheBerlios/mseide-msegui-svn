<short>MSE GUI Component Library</short>
<descr>
<p>
The MSE GUI Component Library is a set of visual components to create GUI applications for Window and Linux.
No huge toolkits ( Qt,Gtk,.. ) required - the internal Win32 GUI ( Windows ) and XLibs ( Linux ) are used to draw widgets.
It is tightly bound with FPC, not a Delphi clone but more likely Delphi redesign and extention for particular people needs.
